# foggy-dawn
This is a project about my brain.
It often reminds me of a foggy day when I wake up. 
Sometimes it dawns on me that it's been that way all day long.
Sometimes it's so foggy that it thinks I know what to do next, when really I need to continue reading the instructions. Like just now. I think.
